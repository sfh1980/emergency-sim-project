## Project Timeline & Decisions

### Phase 1: Planning & Requirements (Current)
**Date:** [Current Date]

**Key Decisions Made:**
1. **Database Strategy:**
   - SQL Server: Structured data (incidents, units, hospitals, metrics)
   - MongoDB: Unstructured data (detailed logs, real-time streams, analytics)
   - Rationale: SQL for fast queries/reporting, MongoDB for flexibility and real-time data

2. **Incident Types:**
   - Medical emergencies (cardiac arrest, stroke, trauma, respiratory distress)
   - Non-emergencies (informed it's not an emergency)
   - Car accidents, mass casualty events, shootings
   - Multiple priority levels with different call volumes

3. **Geographic Scope:**
   - Richmond, VA city boundaries
   - Using provided `rva-cityboundary.geojson` file
   - Will integrate with Leaflet.js for mapping

4. **EMS Units:**
   - BLS ambulances (Basic Life Support)
   - ALS ambulances (Advanced Life Support) 
   - Supervisor units
   - Simulate availability and coverage gaps

5. **Development Approach:**
   - Start simple, scale up gradually
   - Focus on learning: Python → Database → Dashboard
   - Build mock generator first

**Technical Requirements Identified:**
- Incident data: caller info, description, location, treatment decisions, timestamps, status updates
- Response tracking: dispatched → en route → on scene → patient contact → transport decision → en route to hospital → cleared
- 4 fictional hospitals with different specialties
- Real-time dashboard with map view and metrics
- Scalable data collection for future analytics

**Next Steps:**
- Design data models and classes
- Build Python mock generator
- Set up database schemas
- Create basic incident generation logic

  - **Modern Design:** Glassmorphism effect with backdrop blur and transparency
- **CSS Styling Approach:**
  - **Responsive Design:** Flexible layout that works on different screen sizes
  - **Visual Feedback:** Text shadows and opacity for depth
  - **Accessibility:** High contrast colors for emergency services environment
  - **Learning:** CSS Grid and Flexbox for modern layouts, CSS custom properties for theming
- **Component Structure Planning:**
  - **Components Directory:** Created organized folder structure for modular development
  - **Planned Components:** IncidentTable, UnitStatus, MapView, PriorityFilter, RealTimeUpdates
  - **Learning:** React best practices for component organization and separation of concerns
- **Learning:** React component structure, modern CSS techniques, design system planning, emergency services UI/UX considerations
- **Status:** 🎨 **THEME AND STRUCTURE COMPLETE** - Ready for component development

**Key Technical Decisions Made:**
- Priority levels 1-5 with medical context
- Provider notes included in MongoDB structure
- Faker library chosen for realistic data generation
- Hands-on installation approach for learning
- Richmond-specific address generation for geographic accuracy
- **TypeScript for React development** - Better type safety and developer experience
- **Modular component architecture** - Separation of concerns and maintainability
- **Emergency services color scheme** - Professional and accessible design

## Learning Notes

### Database Design Concepts
- **SQL Server**: Best for structured, relational data that needs fast queries and reporting
- **MongoDB**: Best for flexible schema, real-time streams, and complex document structures
- **Data Flow**: SQL stores "what happened" (facts), MongoDB stores "how it happened" (narrative)

### Python Data Generation Strategy
- Use `faker` library for realistic data generation
- Implement classes for different entity types (Incident, EMSUnit, Hospital)
- Generate random but realistic patterns for call volumes and incident types
- Use Richmond boundary coordinates for location generation

### Real-time Communication Planning
- WebSocket connections for live updates
- SignalR for .NET integration (future consideration)
- Event-driven architecture for scalability

## Questions to Address Later
1. How to handle data consistency between SQL and MongoDB?
2. What analytics patterns will be most valuable?
3. How to implement realistic dispatch algorithms?
4. Performance optimization strategies for real-time data?
